#### How does the $300 grant work?
You'll be given an HCB grant. ALL purchases you need funded by HQ must fit within this HCB grant, including taxes and shipping.

#### Can I use parts I already have?
You can! The only requirement I ask is that you keep the total value of your printer under $500 USD, excluding printed parts. This is to make it somewhat accessible to other hack clubbers!

#### Can I work with a team?
You can! Several limitations:
- If both of you want a travel stipend, each of you must put in at least 125+ hours of work. Log your time in written updates
- Your budget is still limited to $300 USD for the entire device

#### Do I *need* a 3D printer to try this?
You don't! However it is *incredibly* hard to do so without a printer so I highly, *highly* recommend you have a 3D printer by the time your parts arrive. You'll need it to iterate and modify your design quickly, since it's not going to work on the first try. Trust me

#### How are hours tracked?
Written updates! Here's what to do:
- Make a repository for your printer on your account
- Create a file called JOURNAL.md, LOGS.md, or pretty much whatever you want to call it!
- Get the URL to that file. Edit the [config.yaml file](https://github.com/hackclub/infill/blob/main/doc_update_script/config.yaml) of this website to add your printer to the list!
- Within 30 minutes, your journal will automagically be added to the website! Automation by yours truly.

Tip: You can reference static assets in your markdown file, using a relative URL (such as `![My image](images/picture.png)`). Make sure you add `rewrite_urls: Yes` to the config entry for your printer in this repository. This will load the files from the Github CDN. 

#### Do I *need* to have written updates on the website?
Yup! This is for a couple reasons:

- Logging your time & verifying it
- Sharing your progress with other people so that everyone can see where each other is at
- But also..

Take it from someone who's built a printer themselves - it's really, *really* nice to have a log to look back on your journey. I started doing it on a whim for Neutrino, but once I was done it was by far the favourite thing I did outside of designing the printer itself.
